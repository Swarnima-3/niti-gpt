1. Introduction
China has pursued an aggressive innovation-driven development strategy over the past two decades, placing significant policy emphasis on the commercialization of high-tech research and deep technological capabilities. At the center of this strategy is the Torch High Technology Industry Development Program, administered by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), which serves as a foundational framework for incubating, scaling, and internationalizing high-tech enterprises, including those in deep-tech domains.

2. Program Overview
2.1 Torch High Technology Industry Development Program
Established in 1988, the Torch Program aims to promote the transformation of R&D outputs into commercially viable products and enterprises. It facilitates:

High-tech industrial zones (HTZs) across China

State-level science and technology enterprise incubators (STEIs)

University-linked innovation centers

Venture capital funding guidance

Policy incentives including tax relief and procurement access

As of 2023, the Torch Program supports over 170 national high-tech zones, contributing nearly 13% of China's GDP and housing over 100,000 tech enterprises.

2.2 Broader Deep-Tech Support Instruments
In addition to Torch, China supports deep tech through:

National Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016–2030): Emphasizes emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, semiconductors, and biopharma.

Made in China 2025: Focuses on reducing dependence on foreign technology by fostering domestic deep-tech industries.

High-Level Talent Plans (Thousand Talents Plan, etc.): Recruit global scientific talent for frontier R&D.

3. Key Strengths
3.1 Scale and Integration of High-Tech Zones
The national high-tech zones under Torch (e.g., Zhongguancun in Beijing, Shenzhen Hi-Tech Park) are tightly integrated with research institutes, universities, and industrial clusters. These zones serve as end-to-end innovation corridors — from lab to manufacturing.

In 2022, high-tech zones under Torch attracted over 4 million high-skilled workers and produced over 20% of China’s total patents.

3.2 Government-Led Capital Allocation
Through government guidance funds (e.g., the National SME Development Fund, China Integrated Circuit Investment Fund), deep-tech startups receive both equity investment and non-dilutive support. As of 2021, government guidance funds accounted for over 60% of early-stage funding for hardware and frontier tech startups.

3.3 Rapid Commercialization Ecosystem
Startups benefit from fast-track procurement, industrial pilot programs, and tech transfer partnerships with SOEs (State-Owned Enterprises). Technology applications in energy, transport, health, and defense often receive direct policy prioritization and funding.

3.4 Talent Pipelines
Programs like the "Thousand Talents" and "Changjiang Scholars" create strong pipelines for scientific leadership in key innovation sectors. China's top universities and CAS (Chinese Academy of Sciences) labs often collaborate with spinouts located in Torch Zones.

4. Gaps and Policy Challenges
4.1 Innovation Quality and Research Independence
Despite massive investment, a 2023 OECD study found that only 28% of Chinese high-tech patents had global citations — a proxy for originality. There's an ongoing challenge to move from catch-up innovation to breakthrough innovation.

4.2 Overconcentration in Select Zones
Top zones like Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai receive a disproportionate share of resources. Smaller cities lack comparable infrastructure, leading to regional innovation inequality.

4.3 Regulatory Uncertainty for Startups
While large enterprises often benefit from state backing, smaller startups face administrative complexities, particularly regarding IP protection, data localization, and foreign partnerships.

4.4 Dependence on State-Driven Models
China’s deep-tech ecosystem is heavily state-guided. This can limit private sector risk-taking and dampen organic venture capital development. In 2022, over 70% of funding for early-stage semiconductor and biotech ventures came from public channels.

5.China’s Torch Program represents one of the most ambitious and long-standing examples of state-facilitated deep-tech ecosystem building. Through high-tech zones, targeted funding, and institutional support, it has succeeded in creating scale and infrastructure for innovation. However, to fully realize leadership in frontier science and technology, future efforts must focus on:

Improving originality and global competitiveness of R&D

Enhancing support for private and regional startup ecosystems

Simplifying regulatory and administrative interfaces for innovators

As global competition in deep tech accelerates, China’s evolution from scale-driven to quality-driven innovation policy will be a critical determinant of long-term impact.
