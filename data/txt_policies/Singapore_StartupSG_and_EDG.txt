1. Introduction
Singapore has emerged as a leading innovation and entrepreneurship hub in Asia, driven by deliberate and structured policy mechanisms to support deep-tech startups. Central to this strategy are two flagship programs: Startup SG, which provides early-stage support and market access, and the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG), which facilitates innovation, productivity, and market expansion through co-funding mechanisms.

These programs align with Singapore’s Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 (RIE2025) strategy, which allocates S$25 billion over five years toward advancing science, technology, and commercialization.

2. Program Overview
2.1 Startup SG
Launched by Enterprise Singapore (ESG) in 2017, Startup SG is a platform comprising multiple tracks tailored to different startup needs:

Startup SG Founder: Provides mentorship and S$50,000 in capital grants for first-time founders.

Startup SG Tech: Offers early-stage Proof-of-Concept (POC) and Proof-of-Value (POV) grants of up to S$500,000 for deep-tech solutions.

Startup SG Equity: Government co-investment with accredited VCs into deep-tech startups, with up to S$8 million in matched equity.

2.2 Enterprise Development Grant (EDG)
The EDG supports businesses developing capabilities in innovation, productivity, and market access. For deep-tech ventures, EDG:

Covers up to 70% of eligible costs for R&D, automation, and product development

Encourages international expansion through market development projects

Prioritizes projects aligned with Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs)

3. Key Strengths
3.1 Structured Co-Investment Model
Singapore’s government co-invests in startups alongside private investors. The Startup SG Equity scheme provides tiered matching (e.g., 7:3 or 6:4) based on startup maturity, de-risking private capital and incentivizing participation in high-risk sectors such as biotech, medtech, and advanced manufacturing.

3.2 Grant-Driven Innovation Push
Startup SG Tech and EDG grants ensure capital access at early TRLs. According to ESG’s 2023 report, over S$200 million was deployed in deep-tech grants between 2020–2022, supporting more than 600 startups.

3.3 Integration with National R&D and IP Ecosystems
Deep-tech startups are embedded in Singapore’s broader R&D landscape, including A*STAR research institutes, the National Research Foundation (NRF), and IPOS (Intellectual Property Office of Singapore), ensuring alignment between research outcomes and commercialization pathways.

3.4 Talent and Globalization Support
Through Tech.Pass, EntrePass, and Startup SG Talent, the ecosystem supports international founders, researchers, and engineers. As of 2022, over 35% of deep-tech startups in Singapore were founded or co-founded by foreign entrepreneurs.

Singapore’s role as a regional HQ hub also enables global market access via ASEAN, India, and East Asia.

4. Challenges and Policy Gaps
4.1 High Burn Rates and Limited Follow-On Capital
Despite strong early-stage support, several deep-tech startups face challenges raising Series B and beyond. Singapore's VC landscape remains cautious in sectors with long commercialization timelines. According to DealStreetAsia (2023), fewer than 18% of Singapore deep-tech startups that raised seed funding in 2019–2020 progressed to Series A or beyond.

4.2 Fragmentation in IP Commercialization Channels
While institutional IP generation is high, the transition from R&D to venture creation remains uneven. A 2021 A*STAR review noted that only 6.4% of licensed technologies led to commercial ventures, indicating a need for stronger tech transfer models.

4.3 Limited Domestic Demand for Deep Tech
Singapore’s small domestic market means many startups must expand regionally early. This poses additional hurdles in terms of localization, distribution, and regulatory navigation, particularly in medtech and clean tech.

5.Singapore’s Startup SG and EDG programs offer a robust and well-structured policy architecture to enable deep-tech startups. The ecosystem benefits from high institutional coherence, public-private co-investment, and strategic use of R&D assets. While access to follow-on capital and IP commercialization efficiency remain areas for improvement, Singapore continues to be a model of integrated deep-tech policy execution, especially in resource-constrained environments.
