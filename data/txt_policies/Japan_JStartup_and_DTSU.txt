An Evaluation of J-Startup and the Deep-Tech Startups Support Program (DTSU)
1. Introduction
Japan has implemented a set of high-impact programs to foster deep-tech innovation and strengthen its global startup competitiveness. Among the most prominent are the J-Startup initiative and the Deep-Tech Startups Support Program (DTSU). These efforts aim to position Japan as a leading hub for science-driven entrepreneurship in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, materials science, robotics, and clean energy.

2. Program Overview
2.1 J-Startup
Launched by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in 2018, J-Startup is a flagship initiative to identify and support Japan’s most promising startups. Selected companies receive:

Priority access to government procurement opportunities

Tailored mentorship and advisory services

Inclusion in international exhibitions and investor roadshows

Support in regulatory navigation and product localization

The program is highly selective, with only 140 companies selected between 2018 and 2023.

2.2 Deep-Tech Startups Support Program (DTSU)
DTSU focuses on bridging the “valley of death” in deep-tech commercialization by providing:

Research-to-market subsidies and grants

Infrastructure for international scale-up

Access to academic-industry-government collaboration platforms

The DTSU program is backed by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization), with a specific emphasis on translational R&D in critical sectors.

3. Key Strengths
3.1 Strategic Focus on Deep Tech
Japan’s programs are purpose-built for startups with long gestation periods and high capital intensity. According to METI’s 2023 Innovation Strategy Report, over 40% of government startup R&D funding in 2022 went to deep tech fields.

3.2 Integration with Corporate and Public Sector
J-Startup offers a unique mechanism where selected startups are introduced directly to large Japanese conglomerates for joint R&D, procurement, or investment. This ecosystem-level integration accelerates technology adoption and reduces market entry barriers.

3.3 Immigration and Talent Incentives
Japan’s startup visa program enables qualified foreign entrepreneurs to start businesses with relaxed residency conditions. As of 2022, over 400 foreign-led startups were operating in Japan, a significant increase from fewer than 50 in 2016.

3.4 Global Expansion Infrastructure
Through JETRO and METI partnerships, selected startups gain access to:

Global startup expos (e.g., CES, Slush, Web Summit)

Bilateral trade missions

Soft-landing support in Asia, North America, and Europe

4. Pain Points and Gaps
4.1 Investment Conservatism in Private Sector
Despite policy efforts, Japan’s venture capital ecosystem remains cautious. According to PitchBook (2023), deep-tech startups in Japan raised only $1.8 billion in 2022, compared to $7.9 billion in South Korea and $14.2 billion in Germany. Seed and Series A financing for hardware-intensive startups remains limited.

4.2 Fragmentation Beyond Flagship Initiatives
While J-Startup provides a well-funded and centralized approach, many regional programs lack coordination, funding continuity, or thematic focus. This leads to uneven support quality across prefectures.

4.3 Ambiguity in Deep Tech Definitions
Stakeholder consultations conducted by NEDO in 2023 indicated a lack of consensus on what constitutes "deep tech," resulting in misalignment in eligibility criteria across agencies.

5. Japan’s J-Startup and DTSU programs illustrate the impact of focused, high-touch government support in building a globally competitive deep-tech ecosystem. While the approach shows measurable success in flagship cases, addressing the fragmentation and risk-aversion in the broader ecosystem remains essential. Countries seeking to replicate Japan’s model should prioritize coordination, targeted deep-tech policy definitions, and sustained venture ecosystem stimulation.
